# Project: HTML/CSS - Google Search Results Page #

This is my working solution for the advanced version of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)'s first HTML/CSS project: create the Google search results page.  

The initial challenge was to recreate the Google homepage; my solution to that challenge is available [here](https://github.com/jwern/google-homepage).
